In this course I learned both front and back-end development by using latest technologies, including Javascript, React, Node and Web3 development

<br />

## Example of my project : NFTs blockchain
---

### Overview
<br />
In this project, I used Motoko, node.js, HTML, CSS, React, and dfx Internet Computer commands to create this NFTs blockchain.

<br />

### Project Submission
[my NFTs blockchain project](https://github.com/Prakaiprajit/The-Complete-2022-Web-Development-Bootcamp/tree/master/NFT-blockchain-project/opend)

### User Experience

* Users can mint their own NFTs, and It will generate a Principal Id that can be used to identify the owner.

<br />

* Users can see their own id and sell their NFTs in the NFTs collection. After they sell, the NFTs become blurred and show Listed beside the name, indicating that you can no longer access it.

<br />

* Users can see a buy button after I create a new NFT for testing (note: it is not going to show you a buy button because it is the same Principal Id that you can not buy your own NFTs)
